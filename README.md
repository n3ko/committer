Conventional Committer is a git commit formatter, it formats your commits into the [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.3/) style, but with extra information embedded:

```
<TYPE>([SCOPE]): <TITLE> <EMOJI>

[BODY] [ISSUE]
```

Where elements like `<*>` are required and elements like `[*]` are optional:

- `TYPE` is one of `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `docs`, `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `refactor`, `revert`, `style`, `test`.
- `SCOPE` is the part of the project the commit changes.
- `TITLE` commit message.
- `EMOJI` see [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/) for full list.
- `BODY` commit description
- `ISSUE` issue or PR commit is in reference to.

Emojis come from [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/) and outline the commit type, so you can quickly see what the commit is in reference to. Committing in this style allows you to use tools like [conventional-changelog-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/conventional-changelog-cli) to generate changelogs, like this [project's](https://github.com/wel-shy/committer/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
